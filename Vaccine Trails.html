        <h1>COVID-19 Vaccine</h1><hr>
        <img src="C:\Images/vaccine1.jpg" width="300px" height="200px" align="right">
        A <b>COVID‑19 vaccine</b> is a biotechnology product intended to provide acquired immunity against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19). As of September 2020, there were 321 vaccine candidates in development, a 2.5 fold increase since April, with no candidate having completed clinical trials to prove its safety and efficacy. In September, some 39 vaccine candidates were in clinical research, 33 in Phase I–II trials, and 6 beginning Phase II-III trials.
       <p>Previous work to develop a vaccine against the coronavirus diseases SARS and MERS established considerable knowledge about the structure and function of coronaviruses – which accelerated rapid development during early 2020 of varied technology platforms for a COVID‑19 vaccine.</p>
         <p>The World Health Organization (WHO), the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), and the Gates Foundation are committing money and organizational resources for the prospect that several vaccines will be needed to prevent continuing COVID‑19 infection. The CEPI, which is organizing a US$2 billion worldwide fund for rapid investment and development of vaccine candidates, indicated in September that clinical data to support licensure may be available by the end of 2020. On 4 May 2020, the WHO organized a telethon which received US$8.1 billion in pledges from forty countries to support rapid development of vaccines to prevent COVID‑19 infections. At the same time, the WHO also announced the deployment of an international "Solidarity trial" for simultaneous evaluation of several vaccine candidates reaching Phase II–III clinical trials.</p>
       <h2>COVID-19 vaccine development in 2020</h2><hr>
       A vaccine for an infectious disease has never before been produced in less than several years, and no vaccine exists for preventing a coronavirus infection in humans.[6] After the coronavirus was detected in December 2019, the genetic sequence of COVID‑19 was published on 11 January 2020, triggering an urgent international response to prepare for the outbreak and hasten development of a preventative vaccine.
    <P>In February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative virus, to become available in less than 18 months. The rapidly growing infection rate of COVID‑19 worldwide during early 2020 stimulated international alliances and government efforts to urgently organize resources to make multiple vaccines on shortened timelines, with four vaccine candidates entering human evaluation in March </P>
     <P>In April 2020, the WHO estimated a total cost of US$8 billion to develop a suite of three or more vaccines having different technologies and distribution. By April 2020, "almost 80 companies and institutes in 19 countries" were working on this virtual gold rush. Also in April, CEPI estimated that as many as six of the vaccine candidates against COVID‑19 should be chosen by international coalitions for development through Phase II–III trials, and three should be streamlined through regulatory and quality assurance for eventual licensing at a total cost of at least US$2 billion. Another analysis estimates 10 candidates will need simultaneous initial development, before a select few are chosen for the final path to licensing.</P>
